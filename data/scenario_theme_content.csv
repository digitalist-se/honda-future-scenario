tech_titans,energy,Energy,Tech Titans,,"While Europe shows some progress to green tech - with a good mix of solar and wind in the electricity generation profile, there is still reliance on fossil power.",
tech_titans,parliament,NEWS,14.01.2035,Who makes the Policy here?,"Pressure builds on Governments as global tech corporations use their influence to create advantageous regulatory frameworks for innovation - which is utilised elsewhere before Europe. European start-ups suffer as large firms control the markets.  
As personalisation grows, there is pushback from some groups against the 'algorithmic' nature of what people see online, and mistrust in the news is growing as people want to know who is behind the stories they see.",
